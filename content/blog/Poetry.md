These are poems written by me slowly over time. The newest one is about a year old. The oldest is about 3 years old. They're not very good.

## Spilled Secrets

The wind blows through the leaves  
carrying countless secrets.

The leaves steal the secrets from the wind  
and whisper them to the gossiping birds

The birds gossip about them  
and spill the secrets onto the world

The world absorbs them.

## Footsteps In The Forest

Footsteps in the forest.  
Voices in the brush.  
Shadows in the night.

## Beautiful Birdsong

Beautiful birdsong  
so pretty in the background.  
Music to my ears.

## Binary 

Binary is so simple  
why can’t life be that way?  
There would only be yes or no  
oh, think of how easy the choices would be.   
but then on the other hand  
a black and white life would be boring.

## White. vs. Black

White is the color of emptiness  
but it is also the color of fullness.  
Everything is nothing  
because you can not compare everything to anything.

Black is nothing.  
Black is the absence of light.  
Black is just an absence.

White is everything, but you can not see it.  
Black is nothing, but it is easy to see.  
You notice when something's missing  
but you don’t when everything's there.

## CHAOS

Yelling.  
Shouting.  
Talking loudly.  
Conversations  
overlapping, into a spinning bunch of chaos.

## A Rainy Night

Rain patters against my window  
while I lay warm and safe in my bed.  
A car drives by. 

## A Calming Day

A cool wind blows fresh air onto me.  
It blows away my stress.  
The sun shines on my face, infusing me with calm.  
Birds chirp in the nearby trees, filling my ears with music  
making me forget  
about all my worries.

## Poetry tree

If you were to bow a tree  
don’t bow the poetry tree.  
For if you were to bow the poetry tree  
The poet of the poetry tree would kill you  
and spill you  
all over the roots  
of the poetry tree.

## Writer's Block

I don’t know what to write.  
It really is a fright.  
It's as if a cog  
is blocking my writing flow?  
I don’t know.
