description: An in-verse poetry-like story. This is the first section, which in my opinion is quite bad.

## A Witch
I walk.
Down to the market.
Second shadows
following all.
I dare not tell anyone.
For they might mark me insane.
I have seen
inside the madhouse.
Visiting my poor old grandma.
“A witch”
They called her.
She died in there.
It took only a week.
When she went in
she was healthy.

## A Different Way of Looking
The shadows
are not any different
from their objects.
Seeing them
is just another way of looking.
Another way of looking,
at the world.


## Ropes
Shadows
are tightly tied to their objects.
They are their objects.
Just from a different perspective.
But some
Like my grandma
Could break those bonds.
Or at least loosen them.
I’ve heard of very few who could set shadows
completely free.
Grandma told me
that if I could see them
it meant I would,
at some point,
be able to fiddle with their ropes.
“Magic”
The townspeople said.
“Dark magic”
For it was not from the gods.

## The Market
The kiosks
are filled with fruits,
vegetables,
pastries.
Price tags.
But the tags
mean nothing.
I peer at the shadows
of the sellers.
Calculate their stubbornness.
How much they value their wares.
How much they value money.
The price tag for oranges reads
₴3.95
Too much.
His self-confidence is small
I can see it.
I say
That is a silly price
For just one orange.
He puts up a sign.
“Buy one get one free”

## Drought
I feel something coming over the hills.
Dry air.
Exhaustion.
Heat.
Death.
Something that approaches.
It never begins.
Or it does begin.
But when it does,
It is not yet named.
A lack of something.
For how long
I cannot tell.
I also cannot tell
My family
that it is coming.
For then they would know
my secret

## Grapes
Our grapes fruit
In gallons.
Sensing
The impending hardship.
Funny how they can do that.
“Make jam”
My brothers say.
“Wine”
I say.
“The prices are high at the market.”
The wine will not
 be fermented
By the time the drought comes
so it will only be grape juice.

## Kegs
We spend the next week
Laboring away
Filling the kegs with grape juice.
Sterilizing everything.
I know
That sterilizing won’t matter.
It won’t be in there for long.
We fill 3
Twenty-gallon kegs.

## Worried
“It hasn’t rained for a month”
The townspeople say.
“The wells are low”
“The stream is dry”
“9 cups a day”
Is the amount they say.
That means,
If we don’t share,
The kegs will last
for 21 nights.
One month,
If you count the ten days
In which the pond
will still be there.

## Theft
I am in the market.
Buying fruit
and gossip.
The fruit is much more expensive now.
Without water
They cannot grow.
Then I feel a sense
of anger,
desperation
Sympathy.
“They’re taking the wine.”
I say to my brother.
No, not to my brother.
I just say it.
And my brother hears.
We run back
to the house.
A group of people
In the basement.
“It must be shared”
They say. 
They leave none for us.

## Running
“How did she know?”
“Witch”
“Just like her Grandma”
they say.
I listen
hiding around the corner.
I must flee.
