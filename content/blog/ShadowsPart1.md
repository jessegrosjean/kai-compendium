## A Witch
I walk.
Down to the market.
Second shadows
following all.
I dare not tell anyone.
For they might mark me insane.
I have seen
inside the madhouse.
Visiting my poor old grandma.
“A witch”
They called her.
She died in there.
It took only a week.
When she went in
she was healthy.

## A Different Way of Looking
The shadows
are not any different
from their objects.
Seeing them
is just another way of looking.
Another way of looking,
at the world.


## Ropes
Shadows
are tightly tied to their objects.
They are their objects.
Just from a different perspective.
But some
Like my grandma
Could break those bonds.
Or at least loosen them.
I’ve heard of very few who could set shadows
completely free.
Grandma told me
that if I could see them
it meant I would,
at some point,
be able to fiddle with their ropes.
“Magic”
The townspeople said.
“Dark magic”
For it was not from the gods.

## The Market
The kiosks
are filled with fruits,
vegetables,
pastries.
Price tags.
But the tags
mean nothing.
I peer at the shadows
of the sellers.
Calculate their stubbornness.
How much they value their wares.
How much they value money.
The price tag for oranges reads
₴3.95
Too much.
His self-confidence is small
I can see it.
I say
That is a silly price
For just one orange.
He puts up a sign.
“Buy one get one free”

## Drought
I feel something coming over the hills.
Dry air.
Exhaustion.
Heat.
Death.
Something that approaches.
It never begins.
Or it does begin.
But when it does,
It is not yet named.
A lack of something.
For how long
I cannot tell.
I also cannot tell
My family
that it is coming.
For then they would know
my secret

## Grapes
Our grapes fruit
In gallons.
Sensing
The impending hardship.
Funny how they can do that.
“Make jam”
My brothers say.
“Wine”
I say.
“The prices are high at the market.”
The wine will not
 be fermented
By the time the drought comes
so it will only be grape juice.

## Kegs
We spend the next week
Laboring away
Filling the kegs with grape juice.
Sterilizing everything.
I know
That sterilizing won’t matter.
It won’t be in there for long.
We fill 3
Twenty-gallon kegs.

## Worried
“It hasn’t rained for a month”
The townspeople say.
“The wells are low”
“The stream is dry”
“9 cups a day”
Is the amount they say.
That means,
If we don’t share,
The kegs will last
for 21 nights.
One month,
If you count the ten days
In which the pond
will still be there.

## Theft
I am in the market.
Buying fruit
and gossip.
The fruit is much more expensive now.
Without water
They cannot grow.
Then I feel a sense
of anger,
desperation
Sympathy.
“They’re taking the wine.”
I say to my brother.
No, not to my brother.
I just say it.
And my brother hears.
We run back
to the house.
A group of people
In the basement.
“It must be shared”
They say. 
They leave none for us.

## Running
“How did she know?”
“Witch”
“Just like her Grandma”
they say.
I listen
hiding around the corner.
I must flee.

## Lost
Where do I go?
I do not think.
Trees crowd around me.
The path
is gone.

## The Forest
Trees,
loom.
Their boney limbs 
grab at me.
This part of the forest
is dead.
Long dead.
It’s old.
Older than the mountains.
Stories say
that these were ents.
And nothing
dares touch them.
Not even time itself.
But time
is in
The space around them.
Thicker than the mist.

## An Empty Field
The trees part
but the time follows me.
It wraps around my ankles
flows down my back.
But for some reason,
It does not touch me.
I feel no thirst nor hunger.
I walk
forever.
The time
guards me from exhaustion.
I can’t remember
when I last stopped.

## A Cliff Looking Over The Sea
The field,
ends.
Cliffs,
drop down to the sea.
The sea
is alive.
Am I alive?
The crashing waves
break the silence.
The silence that has followed me
since I entered the forest.
It is friends with time.

The sun
is alive.
It gives the world color
and warmth.

The wind
is alive.
No-
life is
the wind.
The wind blows away the mist
the mist of time.

## Wind
The wind
is alive.
It spends its life
whispering secrets
No one, understanding.
But sometimes
It finds its voice
and it howls
screams
and shares
its beautiful knowledge
of the world of which it has traveled.

## Soaring Towards the Land of Life
The wind
lifts me off my feet.
Sweeps me into the sky
Carries me over the sea.
I have heard its tales
and want to see
This fabled Land of Life.
I soar
like a bird.
Am I a bird?
I look around me
and see
other birds
flying together
with me?
Soaring towards
this fabled Land of Life.

## A Trail With no Destination
The wind
gently puts me down.
My feet touch the grass.
A long, winding trail
trails out in front of me.
We have arrived
whispers the wind.
“But this is no place”
“It’s just a trail”
But isn’t it beautiful?
“Yes, but where does it lead?”
“Where does it end?”
It leads onwards
It ends 
in the land of death.
But don’t 
worry 
about
that.
Just enjoy the stroll.

## An Unnamed Town
The path
flows through a town.
A town
not unlike
the one I left
all that time ago.
But that means
that it will have
 the same problems.

## The townsfolk
avert their gaze
as I walk by.
They sense
that I am different.
“Where is the next town?”
“No, where is the next city?”
I try to say.
I wonder if cities
would be less wary
of difference. 
I try to ask
but my voice is weak
dry
light.
This is the first time I’ve spoken
since I fled.
That was days ago
weeks ago
years ago?
I try again.
“Kzxandra”
A towns-person says
then scurries away.
The path twists
turns
and points
towards the city 
of Kzxandra.

## Kzxandra
The city folds out in front of me.
Walls
surround every side. 
I walk
through the gates.
Crowds 
swarm the streets.
Noise
 fills the air.
I sink
into the background.

## The Crowd
I am pushed into the crowd.
I fall
into the sea of people.
I am drowning.
the rapids throw me
deeper and deeper.
I try to call out for help
but none comes.
I’m not angry.
They would help
if only they could see me.
I am invisible.
lost in the crowd.
Lost
in a sea of people.

## The Meeting
I am a ghost.
I walk through the crowd.
I sink towards a large house.
I drift through the door
the guards don’t see me.
Around a table
sit eight,
well-dressed
people.
They talk by candlelight.
Shadows,
creep
in the corners of the room.
Am I
a shadow?
They all hold scissors.
No, they are scissors.
I am a knife.
They can cut with precision
but I can cut with power.

## Out From the Shadows
I step out
from the shadows
into 
the candlelight. 
They turn with surprise.
“How did she get in?”
“Who are you,”
and why are you here?”
“How old are you,”
“traveler?”
They look at me in awe.
They have killed dragons
ended droughts
raised islands.
But the shadows I carry
are heavy.
“My age left me,”
“long ago.”
I tell them my story
at least what is remembered.
