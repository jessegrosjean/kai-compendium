This post builds upon the previous post. To best understand, reading the previous post first is highly recommended. 

In the last post we found an explicit formula for the general recursive sequence:

$$a_n = r(a_{n-1}) + d$$

In this post we will add to this recursive formula so to describe a larger variety of sequences. The new sequence will be:

$$a_n = r(a_{n-1}) + xn + d$$

As you can see, we added the term $xn$
