## Lost
Where do I go?
I do not think.
Trees crowd around me.
The path
is gone.

## The Forest
Trees,
loom.
Their boney limbs 
grab at me.
This part of the forest
is dead.
Long dead.
It’s old.
Older than the mountains.
Stories say
that these were Ents.
And nothing
dares touch them.
Not even time itself.
But time
is in
The space around them.
Thicker than the mist.

## An Empty Field
The trees part
but the time follows me.
It wraps around my ankles
flows down my back.
But for some reason,
It does not touch me.
I feel no thirst nor hunger.
I walk forever.
The time
guards me from exhaustion.
I can’t remember
when I last stopped.

## A Cliff Looking Over The Sea
The field ends.
Cliffs drop down to the sea.
The sea
is alive.
Am I alive?
The crashing waves
break the silence.
The silence that has followed me
since I entered the forest.
It is friends with time.

The sun
is alive.
It gives the world color
and warmth.

The wind
is alive.
No-
life is
the wind.
The wind blows away the mist
the mist of time.

## Wind
The wind
is alive.
It spends its life
whispering secrets
No one, understanding.
But sometimes
It finds its voice
and it howls
screams
and shares
its beautiful knowledge
of the world of which it has traveled.

## Soaring Towards the Land of Life
The wind
lifts me off my feet.
Sweeps me into the sky
Carries me over the sea.
I have heard its tales
and want to see
This fabled Land of Life.
I soar
like a bird.
Am I a bird?
I look around me
and see
other birds
flying together
with me?
Soaring towards
this fabled Land of Life.

## A Trail With no Destination
The wind
gently puts me down.
My feet touch the grass.
A long, winding trail
trails out in front of me.
We have arrived
whispers the wind.
“But this is no place”
“It’s just a trail”
But isn’t it beautiful?
“Yes, but where does it lead?”
“Where does it end?”
It leads onwards
It ends 
in the land of death.
But don’t 
worry 
about
that.
Just enjoy the stroll.
