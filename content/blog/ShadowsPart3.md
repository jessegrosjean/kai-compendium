A little worse than the second part, a bit better than the first.

## An Unnamed Town  
The path
flows through a town.  
A town  
not unlike  
the one I left  
all that time ago.  
But that means  
that it will have  
 the same problems.  
  
## The townsfolk  
avert their gaze  
as I walk by.  
They sense  
that I am different.  
“Where is the next town?”  
“No, where is the next city?”  
I try to say.  
I wonder if cities  
would be less wary  
of difference.   
I try to ask  
but my voice is weak  
dry  
light.  
This is the first time I’ve spoken  
since I fled.  
That was days ago  
weeks ago  
years ago?  
I try again.  
“Kzxandra”  
A towns-person says  
then scurries away.  
The path twists  
turns  
and points  
towards the city   
of Kzxandra.  
  
## Kzxandra  
The city folds out in front of me.  
Walls  
surround every side.   
I walk  
through the gates.  
Crowds   
swarm the streets.  
Noise  
 fills the air.  
I sink  
into the background.  
  
## The Crowd  
I am pushed into the crowd.  
I fall  
into the sea of people.  
I am drowning.  
the rapids throw me  
deeper and deeper.  
I try to call out for help  
but none comes.  
I’m not angry.  
They would help  
if only they could see me.  
I am invisible.  
lost in the crowd.  
Lost  
in a sea of people.  
  
## The Meeting  
I am a ghost.  
I walk through the crowd.  
I sink towards a large house.  
I drift through the door  
the guards don’t see me.  
Around a table  
sit eight,  
well-dressed  
people.  
They talk by candlelight.  
Shadows,  
creep  
in the corners of the room.  
Am I  
a shadow?  
They all hold scissors.  
No, they are scissors.  
I am a knife.  
They can cut with precision  
but I can cut with power.  
  
## Out From the Shadows  
I step out  
from the shadows  
into   
the candlelight.   
They turn with surprise.  
“How did she get in?”  
“Who are you,”  
and why are you here?”  
“How old are you,”  
“traveler?”  
They look at me in awe.  
They have killed dragons  
ended droughts  
raised islands.  
But the shadows I carry  
are heavy.  
“My age left me,”  
“long ago.”  
I tell them my story  
at least what is remembered.
